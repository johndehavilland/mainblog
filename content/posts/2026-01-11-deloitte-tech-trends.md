Perusing the Deloitte Tech Trends of 2026 - https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends.html

Some notes of thinks I found interesting
* Conversations with leaders are moving from "what can we do with AI?" to "how do we move from experimentation to impact". 
* Things with AI feel urgent, but, this is driven by the speed of the change more than anything - the broad use of AI by over 50 million people happened in just 2 months, 300x times faster than the adoption of the telephone and 84x faster than adoption of the internet. This is driving faster time to value, scaling faster and technology adoption faster.
* The robots are coming - AI is helping accelerate the robotics field (check out Boston Dynamics video from CES - ). Advances that drove LLM advances are now being applied to the robotics world in the form of vision plus language equals action. Ayanna Howard, a roboticist at Ohio State University, said that she believes there should always be a human in the loop somewhere, this will get over the concept and challenge around over trust of automated and AI systems. interestingly, labor shortages are potentially driving faster advances in the robotic space.
* Organisation's need to move faster and also fundamentally change.
* Enterprises are still mainly in the phase of automating what they know versus doing different things completely. Gartner suggest 40% of agentic projects will fail because organizations are trying to automate broken processes vs completely rethink operations.
The challenge with these are, but these tasks were often designed by and for humans, and so we now need to start to reimagine how what's going to be done
