America's AI Action Plan was unveiled earlier this month. It focuses on 3 core pillars: Accelerate AI Innovation, Build American AI Infrastructure and Lead in International AI Diplomacy and Security.

## Pillar 1: Accelerate AI Innovation

I like how this leads with removing red tape and bureaucracy. We are too early in this current AI wave of innovation to overdo overly limiting its potential. It reminds a bit of not optimizing until you need to.
The objective element of LLMs and beyond feels challenging to enforce.
I think the encouragement of open-sourcing AI models and open-sourcing weights as well is awesome. It becomes easier for others to build innovation on top of this innovation - kind of like the world wide web in its beginnings. It also allows global adoption which could lead to broader leadership across the globe from an American perspective.
Enable AI Adoption is noble but hard. If we look at tech adoption in history it was never rapid, AI certainly could up end that model but the human element of change management comes to the fore. It also speaks to the fact that, in history, those nations who can adopt the newer technology faster and infuse it faster throughout their ecosystems, lead on innovation. This is laid out in xxx book where he explores how just creating the innovation doesn't mean it bestows an advantage on the nation in which it is found but more importantly being able to enable that across the nation is the deciding factor.

Helping focus on AI skilling is critical to this.

Building out world-class datasets especially in science is a great focus. Without data, what would AI really be. But garbage in, garbage out rings true too - so clean and strong datasets are imperative.
Love the call out of AI Adoption within government - making the US Gov customer zero for some of this could be materially impactful for lives of Americans.

## Pillar 2: Build American AI Infrastructure

THe big theme here (and in other areas) is energy. AI needs energy, both for training and also for inference (i.e. people using it to do things) and America is falling short in its ability to meet potential energy demands of this AI revolution, putting us behind global challengers like China.

Big focus is not just expanding the grid but stablizing it too.

Additionally focus on semi conductor building

Broad infra skilling

## Pillar 3: Lead in International AI Diplomacy and Security
Support our Allies by giving them access to our tech
Manage export controls
Security risks that frontier models pose, especially around biology
