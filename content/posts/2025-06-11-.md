ARR, or Annual Recurring Revenue, is a key metric used to measure the predictable and consistent revenue a business expects to receive over a year from recurring subscriptions or contracts. It used to be that achieving $1 million ARR in year 1 would stand you in really good stead as a start-up. Now the top start-ups are 5x-ing that. AI is changing the game. Interestingly, B2C companies are outpacing B2B ones driven by changing consumer behavior. Andresson Horwotiz has a [nice breakdown](https://a16z.com/revenue-benchmarks-ai-apps/) on this and I love that they call out the fact that *speed is the moat*.

Which kind of reminds me of this perhaps

Taken to the extreme, folks are exploring using AI to build software end to end from scratch. A recent example I [read](https://outervationai.substack.com/p/building-a-100-llm-written-standards) was from Jonathan Barned who used the robust and details http 2.0 spec to get a LLM to build a HTTP 2.0 web server from scratch. Super compelling to read about, and implies that with a detailed enough specification and validation tools. Took 119 hrs and cost $631. Interestingly, this was done in a more workflow approach vs. a more free form agentic approach.

Satya shared that Microsoft engineers are using AI to help write software (up to 20-30%) in a [recent chat](https://www.llama.com/resources/videos/mark-zuckerberg-and-satya-nadella/) with Mark Zuckerburg.

AI is hugely impactful to software development and there is more focus on having engineers use more AI to help super charge their development.
