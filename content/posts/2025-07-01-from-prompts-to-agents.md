AI, Agents, Workflows, LLMS - it all gets a bit confusing in today's AI landscape around what all these mean and when to use which for what. I want to break this down in a fairly simple framework to think about 4 distinct ways of using LLMs that get increasing more complex. 

## 1. Standalone LLM (Prompt in, Information Out)

{{< figure src="/images/2025-07-01-llm-only.png" caption="Standalone LLM" >}}


This is the simplest and easiest way to engage a LLM. You enter a prompt into an LLM and it will respond based solely on its training data and the input you gave it in the prompt. This is most useful when you want a quick, self-contained answer that doesn’t require up-to-date data, personalization, or external reasoning, e.g. summarizing a paragraph, rewriting text, generating titles, or writing social media copy. You can also give it in-prompt context to help improve the answers - a concept often referred to as one/few-shot learning. 

### Example Use Cases
- Copywriting assistant
- Text rewriting or summarization
- Code Snippets

| Benefits                      | Limitations                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Simplicity and speed          | No access to real-time data  |
| Easy to embed in existing apps| Prone to hallucination       |
| Low cost                      | Static behavior              |

## 2. LLM + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

{{< figure src="/images/2025-07-01-llm-rag.png" caption="LLM + RAG" >}}

This takes the standalone LLM and augments it with external knowledge via a search or a database lookup. It often involves semantic search over vector embeddings representing the external knowledge you are augmenting the LLM with. Typically, the user enters a prompt, the prompt is parsed and used to search against a knowledge base where key pieces of information are retrieved and added to the prompt as context and this is all passed to a LLM to get a response. You can enhance your LLM responses with access to private datasets or even real time data. The bottleneck could be how well you approach the initial data retrieval.

### Example Use Cases
- Internal policy chatbot
- Tech support assistant
- Document comparison and audit

| Benefits                                 | Limitations                        |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Access to real-time or custom knowledge   | Requires proper data curation      |
| Domain-specific accuracy                  | Retrieval quality is critical      |
| Maintainable and update-friendly          | Latency increases slightly         |


## 3. AI Workflows (Orchestration of multiple tools and steps)

{{< figure src="/images/2025-07-01-llm-workflow.png" caption="AI Workflow" >}}

Here we are getting more sophisticated workflows where a chain of tools or models are orchestrated. The tools can include APIs, code execution and decision trees etc and the LLM acts as a controller for different steps and services. Often you are looking at something like LangChain or Semantic Kernel to build this

### Example Use Cases
- Document processing (OCR → parse → summarize)
- Multi-step customer interactions
- Lead qualification bot
- Onboarding assistant

| Benefits                          | Limitations                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Structured and deterministic flows | Complex to build and maintain      |
| Reusable building blocks           | Higher latency                     |
| Better control over flow           | Rigid logic                        |

## 4. AI Agents (Autonomous Decision-Makers)

{{< figure src="/images/2025-07-01-llm-agent.png" caption="AI Agents" >}}

This is the most complicated of the workflows. Here you give the LLM a goal and it builds a plan, executes against that plan and achieves the goal. It often includes feedback loops, breaks the goal and plan down into tasks as well as figuring out which tools to access to help achieve the goal. The big difference between this and AI workflows is that AI agents work independently and define the workflows to execute where as with AI Workflow you will have predefined the workflow and steps to execute.

### Example Use Cases
- Customer service agents that escalate when needed
- Research assistants that look up and summarize sources
- DevOps bots that diagnose and resolve incidents

| Benefits                                 | Limitations                        |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Autonomy and adaptability                | Unpredictable behavior             |
| Can pursue complex, multi-step goals      | Harder to debug and test           |
| Long-term, multi-turn interactions        | Resource intensive                 |


Each level adds complexity and capability. Not every task needs an agent, sometimes a simple prompt or RAG is enough so choose the right level based on your use case, perhaps even starting simpler and getting more complex as your needs grow.

Here are **five high-impact example use cases** that scale clearly across four stages of AI workflows: **Standalone LLM → RAG → Workflow → Agent**.
