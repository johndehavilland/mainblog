Perusing the Deloitte Tech Trends of 2026 - https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends.html

Some notes of thinks I found interesting
* Conversations with leaders are moving from "what can we do with AI?" to "how do we move from experimentation to impact". 
* Things with AI feel urgent, but, this is driven by the speed of the change more than anything - the broad use of AI by over 50 million people happened in just 2 months, 300x times faster than the adoption of the telephone and 84x faster than adoption of the internet. This is driving faster time to value, scaling faster and technology adoption faster.
* The robots are coming - AI is helping accelerate the robotics field (check out Boston Dynamics video from CES - )
